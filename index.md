 My Digital Rain Project
------
As part of my fourth year C++ module we were tasked with creating a unique Digtial Rain Project

## *Introduction* 
When brainstorming project ideas, we were shown examples from past years for inspiration. This is where I discovered the concept for my first main component: colors. I knew I wanted a bright, random color display, which kickstarted my search for a way to bring this vision to life. I wanted something unique, something I hadn’t encountered during my research. Eventually, I settled on the idea of using downward slashes (|), which I felt would create a realistic, fast-paced downpour—something common in Ireland. 

To start my project i decided to create a basic version of my vision without colours and just to tackle the rain fall and size of the rain fall. 
## *Design & Research*
This is the first thing i found in my reaserch, it is a previous students blog which she uses colours and explains how she did hers: 
[Sarahs's blog](https://sarahmatu.github.io/DigiRainProject/)

I wanted to have random colour pattern over picked and hardcoded colours. I ended up having a block of different colours cascading down the screen, while this was not my original idea I ended up liking it more then the idea of random colours all together

This is the code to pick the colours used on the project using [ANSI colour](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-ansi.html) with red, green, yellow, blue, megenta and cyan being the 6 colour blocks shown,
